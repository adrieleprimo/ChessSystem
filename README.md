# Welcome to my Chess System ♟️

Hi! I started a project about chess system using **Java** and **Eclipse**.  It's my first project and I'm very happy, I used everything that I learned about  Java and I'm very proud of myself. 


# How can I  run this project? ⁉️
It's very simple, you just need to use the git bash or the cmd. If you use some IDE, the project will not work very well.


Using the directory of the files:
This is my directory:
 /c/temp/ws-eclipse/ChessSystemDesign/bin

 
 I just used the command in the git bash -> java application/Program
 
  ## We use the source and target to move the pieces 👇
